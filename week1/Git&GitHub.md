Git & GitHub
==========================================


##### 1. Please apply for a GitHub account and create a repository then upload your homework to the repository. After the process, please send your repository link to us through Discord direct message and we will check your assignments through your repository every week. We need you to structure your repo as below:
 
    Repository_name 
      -week1
        -[your assignments] 
      -week2
        -[your assignments] 
      -week3
        -[your assignments] 
      -week4
        - [your assignments]
